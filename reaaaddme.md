# Tech 258 - Python

## What is Python? What is the history of Python?

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace.

## Why is Python popular? Why is it particularly popular for DevOps engineers?

Python's popularity stems from its simplicity, versatility, and extensive ecosystem of libraries and frameworks. It is particularly popular among DevOps engineers due to its ease of learning, platform independence, and seamless integration with various technologies commonly used in DevOps, such as cloud platforms, containerization tools, and monitoring systems.

## What is a virtual environment or venv?

A virtual environment, often abbreviated as venv, is a self-contained directory that contains a specific version of the Python interpreter along with its own set of libraries and dependencies. It allows developers to create isolated environments for different projects, ensuring that dependencies for one project do not interfere with another. This is particularly useful for managing dependencies and avoiding conflicts in Python projects.

## What is "pip"?

Pip is the package installer for Python. It is used to install, uninstall, and manage Python packages from the Python Package Index (PyPI) or other package repositories. Pip simplifies the process of installing external libraries and dependencies, making it a crucial tool for Python developers.

## What is scripting? How is it different to programming?

Scripting involves writing small programs or scripts that automate tasks or execute sequences of commands. It is often used for tasks that do not require the complexity of full-fledged programming languages. Scripting languages like Python, Bash, and PowerShell are commonly used in automation, configuration management, and system administration tasks. Scripting is generally considered to be more focused on automation and rapid development compared to programming, which involves more comprehensive software development.

## What are the base/inbuilt Python libraries?

Python comes with a rich set of standard libraries, known as the Python Standard Library, which provides functionality for a wide range of tasks without the need for external dependencies. Some of the base/inbuilt Python libraries include:

- `os` for operating system interfaces
- `sys` for system-specific parameters and functions
- `math` for mathematical functions
- `datetime` for date and time manipulation
- `json` for JSON encoding and decoding
- `re` for regular expressions
- `collections` for data structures
- `socket` for networking

## What are some of the most popular external libraries?

In addition to the base/inbuilt libraries, Python has a vast ecosystem of external libraries and frameworks developed by the community to cater to various needs. Some of the most popular external libraries include:

- `NumPy` for numerical computing
- `Pandas` for data manipulation and analysis
- `Requests` for making HTTP requests
- `Matplotlib` for data visualization
- `Django` and `Flask` for web development
- `TensorFlow` and `PyTorch` for machine learning and deep learning
- `SQLAlchemy` for database interaction

These libraries extend the functionality of Python and empower developers to tackle a wide range of tasks efficiently.
